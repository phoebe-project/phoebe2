PHOEBE 2.0-alpha RELEASE NOTES                                     APR 28, 2014
===============================================================================

Hello and thank you for your interest in PHOEBE 2.0-alpha! This is the first
official pre-release of the 2.0 development branch. Please read these release
notes in their entirety as we discuss important details about the code and
its potential use in scientific data modeling.

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

PHOEBE 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the original PHOEBE 1 code. PHOEBE was
initially based on the Wilson-Devinney code and its sole purpose was to model
light and radial velocity curves of eclipsing binary stars. This new version
of the code has the ability to model any system of objects where their shapes
can be approximated by discretization into surface elements and their geometric
and thermal properties can be approximated as opaque. Thus, PHOEBE does not
solve any equations of state nor energy transport equations. Instead, PHOEBE
considers objects as solid surfaces where each surface element radiates light
according to its local properties (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity,
etc).

PHOEBE 2.0 is no longer based on the Wilson-Devinney code, and 1:1 comparison
between the two codes is no longer possible. That is because PHOEBE builds on
a novel triangulation scheme for surface discretization and includes treatment
of physics that is unsupported in the Wilson-Devinney code. That said, PHOEBE
has been validated against the Wilson-Devinney code to insure scientific
integrity and consistency.

PHOEBE 2.0 is and always will remain free. It is released under the GNU General
Public License (GPL), the copy of which you can find in the top-level COPYING
file. PHOEBE is an open-source project written by professional astronomers
that are listed in the top-level AUTHORS file.

2. DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING AND TESTING PHOEBE 2.0-alpha
-------------------------------------------------------

2.1. REQUIREMENTS
-----------------

To install PHOEBE 2.0-alpha, your system needs to meet the following
requirements:

	* python 2.6 or higher, but not python 3;
	* numpy 1.8.1 or higher;
	* scipy 0.13 or higher;
	* matplotlib 1.3.1 or higher;
	* C compiler (gcc will do just fine);
	* Fortran compiler (gfortran will do just fine).

2.2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION
------------------------------

PHOEBE 2.0-alpha can be downloaded from the PHOEBE website:

	http://phoebe-project.org/downloads/phoebe-2.0a1.tar.gz

Make sure that your system meets all the requirements (section 2.1), unpack the
distribution tarball and follow the generic install procedure for python
modules:

	tar xvzf phoebe-2.0a1.tar.gz
	cd phoebe-2.0a1
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can download and install PHOEBE 2.0-alpha from PIP:

    sudo pip install phoebe

You can also download PHOEBE 2.0-alpha from the subversion repository and
install by following the generic install procedure for python modules:

	svn checkout svn.code.sf.net/p/phoebe/devel
	cd devel
	python setup.py build
	sudo python setup.py install

2.3. TESTING PHOEBE 2.0-alpha
-----------------------------

To test PHOEBE 2.0-alpha operation, go to the top-level phoebe-testlib/
directory and run:

	nosetests

That will go through the whole test library and check if everything is working
as expected. Please notify us if you encounter any problems.

If everything works, we suggest that you proceed to the tutorials available on
the PHOEBE website.

3. STRUCTURE
------------

PHOEBE 2.0 is written in python, C, C++ and Fortran. Its main parts are the
backend, the frontend, and the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This alpha
release includes the backend and the frontend. The GUI will be released with
the beta release on Oct 20 2014. C++ and Fortran are being phased out and the
final release will only use python and C.

3.1. THE BACKEND
----------------

The bulk of PHOEBE 2.0 constitutes a backend: python code that connects all
aspects of PHOEBE into a single unity. The backend is written with flexibility
in mind: it supports any hierarchical grouping of objects, their dynamical
motion, geometric obscuration, and computation of light curves, radial velocity
curves, spectral energy distributions, interferometric visibilities,
astrometric positions, etc. As such, the backend is very complex and using it
comes with a very steep learning curve. The backend also wraps all number-
crunching parts of the code written in C for computational efficiency. Thus,
all PHOEBE functionality is readily available via the backend in python. The
backend is fully documented and the documentation is available on the PHOEBE
website. For those of you familiar with PHOEBE 1 terminology, the backend is
equivalent to PHOEBE 1 library.

3.2. THE FRONTEND
-----------------

Dealing with the complexity of the backend is daunting to most people, and we
do not encourage its direct use. Instead, you are encouraged to use the
frontend. The Frontend is a layer built on top of PHOEBE backend and it serves
as a friendly interface between the user and the backend. It is more limited
in power and flexibility but it allows you to start using PHOEBE essentially
rightaway. The frontend functionality is fully documented and we provide
several tutorials on the PHOEBE website to get you started. For those of you
familiar with PHOEBE 1 terminology, the frontend is equivalent to PHOEBE
scripter.

3.3. THE GUI
------------

The bulk of effort for the alpha release has gone into thoroughly testing the
backend and stabilizing the frontend. The focus of the beta release scheduled
for October 2014 is stabilizing the GUI. Thus, there is no GUI for the alpha
release of PHOEBE 2.0, but we are actively working on it.

3.4. FITTING CAPABILITIES
-------------------------

It may come as a surprise to you that PHOEBE 2.0-alpha has no fitting
capability built in. That's right, no fitting capability whatsoever. However,
that does not mean that you cannot fit your data. It only means that you should
use PHOEBE as the synthesizer of your likelihood function (the Bayesian way of
referring to the model of a system) and an external fitting tool, such as emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2011), for modeling. The beta release will provide hooks
for providing parameter priors and heuristic samplers. To help you make your
first steps with fitting, we provide a tutorial on the PHOEBE website.

4. SCIENCE WITH PHOEBE 2.0-alpha
--------------------------------

DISCLAIMER: There is no warranty, implied or explicit, about the accuracy of
scientific results coming from PHOEBE 2.0-alpha. Use at your own risk! We
strongly urge you /not/ to use this alpha release for scientific results and
to be extremely cautious of all results obtained by this release.

We have tested PHOEBE 2.0-alpha as thoroughly as possible against published
results and against the Wilson-Devinney code, but this being the first release,
PHOEBE 2.0 has /not/ been adequately tested by the community. We prefer to stay
on the conservative side and encourage the use of PHOEBE 2.0-alpha exclusively
for testing purposes. If you do decide to use PHOEBE 2.0-alpha for scientific
results, be warned that major errors might be present in the code. If you still
decide to use PHOEBE 2.0-alpha for scientific results, please contact us for
help with the validation of your results.

5. REPORTING PROBLEMS
---------------------

The alpha release of PHOEBE 2 is the first pre-release that is aimed at users
with prior modeling experience and who are not daunted by problems. While we
tried hard to eliminate all problems that we encountered, there are bound to
be bugs that we have not found yet. We depend on your help to polish the rough
edges as we progress towards the beta release.

We are predominantly looking for three types of feedback:

* problems with code execution and interpretation of code output;
* problems with scientific results;
* problems with syntax and feature requests.

Thus, other than bug reports, we would also like to hear from you about the
current syntax of the frontend, and the intuitiveness of PHOEBE in general --
and what can we do to improve it. The best way to report issues is via the
Bug Tracker available on the PHOEBE website, or by email to the development
mailing list phoebe-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. We are looking forward to
hearing from you!

6. CONCLUSION
-------------

PHOEBE 2.0-alpha is a pre-release and, as such, it is not intended for
production-type work. The scientific results require further validation and
the code might suffer from critical bugs. The alpha release is meant to preview
and provide feedback to us so that we can make PHOEBE 2.0 better for the final
release scheduled for December 2014. We thank you again for your interest in
PHOEBE and look forward to hearing from you about your experience.
