  Synopsis:     set out = resample_spectrum (in, ll, ul, Rs)
  Summary:      Resample the input spectrum on the given interval.
  Description:  This command resamples the input spectrum 'in' to the
                wavelength interval [ll, ul] and sampling power 'Rs'. The
                bins are distributed in log scale, so the value of 'Rs' is
                preserved throughout the wavelength range. If there is no
                overlap between the input spectrum and the passed wavelength
                range, the command will abort.
