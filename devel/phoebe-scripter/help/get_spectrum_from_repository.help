  Synopsis:     set out = get_spectrum_from_repository (Teff, log g, [M/H])
  Summary:      Returns a spectrum by interpolating from the repository
  Description:  This command accesses the spectra repository (set by the
                set_spectra_repository () command), reads in the spectra
                that are in the immediate parameter vicinity, and interpolates
                linearly to obtain the resulting spectrum.
  Arguments:    Teff:  effective temperature in K
                log g: surface gravity acceleration in cgs units
                [M/H]: metallicity in log scale (0 ~ Sun abundance)
