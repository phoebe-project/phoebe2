  Synopsis:     set spout = broaden_spectrum (spin, R)
  Summary:      Broaden the spectrum by Gaussian convolution.
  Description:  This command is used to properly change the true resolution
                of the spectrum while keeping the sampling resolution
                unchanged. This is done by computing the full-width-half-
                maximum (FWHM) from the true resolution at each sampling
                point and convolving it with the Gaussian with a corresponding
                FWHM. It does *not* apply any line-broadening corrections
                such as Doppler or Stark broadening.
