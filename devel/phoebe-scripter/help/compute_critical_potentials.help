  Synopsis:     compute_critical_potentials (q, F, e)
  Summary:      Compute inner (L1) and outer (L2) lobe potentials
  Description:  Takes the mass ratio q=M2/M1, synchronicity parameter F
                and eccentricity e, and computes critical equipotentials
                that correspond to the inner lobe (L1) and the outer lobe
                (L2). It returns an array with two elements: the first
                element is the inner potential and the second element is
                the outer potential.
