This file contains release-critical TODO items. These have to be worked out
for the next testing release to go out. Once an item has been resolved, tick
it.

VERSION 0.31 (by end of 2005)

[ ] A dedicated PHOEBE plotting library to break any external dependency
[ ] Simulated annealing algorithm re-assessment
[ ] Final scripting assessment
[ ] Updated PHOEBE User Manual, PHOEBE Tutorial and PHOEBE API

VERSION 0.30 (by end of September 2005)

[ ] Change grammar rules so that it always takes a variable number of arguments.
[ ] PHOEBE results must be fool-proofed to release a stable version
[ ] Full support for color-index constraint (table readouts) must be done
[ ] SPECS file must be up-to-date
[ ] Limb darkening tables readout must be implemented
[ ] Development specifications freeze for 0.3x versions
[ ] Clear developer status and assignments
[ ] Inline help for commands implemented in scripter
[x] Readline library interface for scripter
[ ] Test scripter functionality
[ ] All PHOEBE functions must return int and implement proper error handling
[ ] Complete scripter-GUI interoperability
[ ] Updated GUI
[ ] Weight functions for DC and NMS are different, they should be unified
[x] Limb darkening interpolation from Van Hamme tables has to be done
[ ] Write a fool-proof version of LDtable lookup function
[ ] DC should use read_in_adjustable_parameters to get its parameters

VERSION 0.30pre4: (by mid-May 2005)

[x] Color index constraint should be implemented (ratios, not tables)
[x] Test scripts should be incorporated via autotools
[x] DC must support Calculate HLA and Calculate VGA options
[x] PHOEBE API must be up-to-date
[x] PHOEBE must be tested on a wider data sample

VERSION 0.30pre3: (by mid-March 2005)

[x] OS directives (ls, cd, pwd, ...) must be incorporated to the scripter
[x] atmcof & atmcofplanck locations should be standardized and used by WD
    functions
[x] PHOEBE API must be up-to-date
[x] phoebe2 must be put under the CVS with the name phoebe-dev
[x] Scripter logic overview
[x] Configuration directory handling
[x] NM Simplex method works either with no or both RVs, it should also work
    with only one RV curve
[x] Implement proper sigma transformation (magnitude or flux to total flux)
    and use it for fitting
[x] DC minimization scheme must be supported
[x] PHOEBE qualifier names must comply with the specifications
[x] Initial values for passband-dependent parameters must be set
[x] Test DC algorithm against a test data suite
[x] Put a proper 0.2x -> 0.30pre3 parameter file converter to tools/
