* The current way of computing the horizon of the star in front (using Fourier
  series decomposition over boundary surface elements) is inaccurate. This
  would be easy to replace with a Newton-Raphson-powered method for getting
  an analytical function over the boundary radii. Which analytical function?
  Perhaps splines. Think this over.

* Units of passband luminosity: total flux is normalized to the flux of the
  primary star × HLA/4\pi. This means that quarter-phase total flux will be 1.0
  for a binary system with primary star an order of magnitude more luminous than
  the secondary (e.g. T1 = 10000K, T2 = 3000K, \Omega1 = \Omega2) and HLA =
  4\pi. Having two stars exactly the same and HLA = 4\pi yields quarter-phase
  total flux 2.0.
