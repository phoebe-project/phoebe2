* Star 1 should be hotter, otherwise the computation won't be precise. To see
  this effect, try plotting a light curve for two identical stars with their
  surface temperatures 3000K and 10000K or 10000K and 3000K. You'll see that
  in the first case the model will go crazy and in the second case it will be
  ok.

* The current way of computing the horizon of the star in front (using Fourier
  series decomposition over boundary surface elements) is inaccurate. This
  would be easy to replace with a Newton-Raphson-powered method for getting
  an analytical function over the boundary radii. Which analytical function?
  Perhaps splines. Think this over.

* Units of passband luminosity: total flux is normalized to the flux of the
  primary star × HLA/4\pi. This means that quarter-phase total flux will be 1.0
  for a binary system with primary star an order of magnitude more luminous than
  the secondary (e.g. T1 = 10000K, T2 = 3000K, \Omega1 = \Omega2) and HLA =
  4\pi. Having two stars exactly the same and HLA = 4\pi yields quarter-phase
  total flux 2.0.
