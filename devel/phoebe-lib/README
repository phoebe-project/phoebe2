PHOEBE-lib-0.30pre5 TOPLEVEL DOCUMENTATION                     October 20, 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello and thank you for your interest in PHOEBE! :-)

WHAT IS THIS THING ANYWAY?
--------------------------

PHOEBE stands for PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs. It is a facility to model
eclipsing binary stars as efficiently and as accurately as possible. PHOEBE
is divided in two parts:

    * PHOEBE library (this package):
    
        PHOEBE library is the modeling engine. It consists of many functions
        that are written to accurately and reliably do tasks related to the
        modeling of eclipsing binaries. It is *not* an executable, only a
		library: you need a driver to access those functions. If you want to
        write your own driver, then the library is all you need. Otherwise
        you may choose among existing drivers (see below).
	
	* PHOEBE driver:

        To access the functions in PHOEBE library, a driver is needed.  The
        driver's task is to make use of library's functions, be it as a self-
        standing program or an interactive interface. Interfaces are usually
        referred to as the front-ends. There are currently two front-ends
        available for PHOEBE: the Scripter and the Graphical user interface.
        Both interfaces are being developped simultaneously to the library.

The idea behind PHOEBE is to relieve scientists from spending unreasonable
amounts of time learning technical details of the given code implementation
and rather use that time for the actual science.

PHOEBE 0.30pre5 is in the stabilizing phase. This means that the code is
expected to run smoothly, it has been tested to some extent and as soon as
sufficient confidence is gained that everything works as expected, the stable
release will come out. It is thus of utmost importance that you provide
feed-back to the authors and let us know your opinions and suggestions. The
best way to get in touch is via PHOEBE discussion mailing list, where both
developers and users share ideas and information on PHOEBE and eclipsing
binaries in general.

As the modeling back-end, PHOEBE 0.30pre5 uses Wilson-Devinney's WD code
released on Oct 17, 2004. You do not need to obtain any WD sources separately,
they are already built into PHOEBE.

LICENSE
-------

PHOEBE is free, released under GNU General public license (GPL). The license
may be found in the top-level file COPYING. PHOEBE always was free and it
always will be. The only price you have to pay is send the developers a
postcard - the address where to send the postcards is given at the end of
this README. We really appreciate postcards, so please do send them - that
is all we ask for our continuous work on PHOEBE! :-)

You may freely share PHOEBE with others as long as no undocumented changes
are imposed on the code. For further information please read the GNU GPL
license in PHOEBE documentation. If you feel you need to change the code
without consulting the developers or joining the development team, please
distribute it with the exact changing policy and a thorough change log. You
are welcome to discuss any ideas and suggestions for modification on PHOEBE
mailing lists.

Do you want to participate in PHOEBE development? That's great, we need your
help! Please contact us and we'll discuss what areas of PHOEBE development are
open for your contribution.
