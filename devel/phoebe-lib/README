PHOEBE-lib-0.30 TOPLEVEL DOCUMENTATION                        November 15, 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello and thank you for your interest in PHOEBE! :-)

WHAT IS THIS THING ANYWAY?
--------------------------

PHOEBE stands for PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs. It is a facility to model
eclipsing binary stars. PHOEBE is divided in two parts:

    * PHOEBE library (this package):
    
        PHOEBE library is the modeling engine. It consists of many functions
        that are written to do tasks related to the modeling of eclipsing
	binaries. It is *not* an executable, only a library: you need a driver
	to access these functions. If you want to write your own driver, then
	the library is all you need. Otherwise you may choose among existing
	drivers (see below).
	
    * PHOEBE driver:

        To access the functions in PHOEBE library, a driver is needed.  The
        driver's task is to make use of the library functions Interfaces are
	usually referred to as the front-ends. There are currently two
	front-ends available for PHOEBE: the Scripter and the Graphical User
	Interface. Both interfaces are being developed simultaneously with
	the library.

The idea behind PHOEBE is to build on the foundations of the renowned
Wilson-Devinney (WD) code and to extend it with new science, new numeric
approaches to modeling, and new technical features. For formal introduction
of PHOEBE see Prsa & Zwitter (2005), ApJ 628, 426.

PHOEBE 0.30 is the first in the new branch. This means that the code is
expected to run smoothly, it has been tested to some extent and there should
be no major show-stoppers. Please report any problems you encounter,
especially crashes (segmentation faults). The best way to get in touch is via
PHOEBE discussion mailing list, or report a bug on PHOEBE homepage.

For modeling back-end PHOEBE 0.30 is based on the Wilson-Devinney (WD) code
(rev. Aug 15 2007). You do not need to obtain any WD sources separately, they
are already built into PHOEBE and will be compiled during the build process.

LICENSE
-------

PHOEBE is free, released under GNU General public license (GPL). The license
may be found in the top-level file COPYING. PHOEBE always was free and it
always will be.

You may freely share PHOEBE with others as long as no undocumented changes
are introduced to the code. For further information please read the GNU GPL
license in PHOEBE documentation. If you feel you need to change the code
without consulting the developers or joining the development team, please
distribute it with the exact changing policy and a thorough change log. You
are welcome to discuss any ideas and suggestions for modification on PHOEBE
mailing lists.

Do you want to participate in PHOEBE development? That's great, we need your
help! Please contact us and we'll discuss what areas of PHOEBE development are
open for your contribution.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

To successfully build PHOEBE-lib from distribution, you need:

    * A Linux machine

	PHOEBE-lib has been successfully tested on the following platforms:

	- Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy)  - no issues (development platform)
	- Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty) - no issues

    * ANSI C compliant compiler (e. g. gcc)
    * GNU make
    * libg2c

INSTALLATION
------------

Please see the generic instructions in the top-level INSTALL file. Usually
the installation boils down to issuing:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
