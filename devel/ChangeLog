  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h:
  Two public functions for accessing the global parameter table have been
  added:

  	phoebe_qualifier_from_index ()
  	phoebe_type_from_index ()

  This should be used instead of the direct PHOEBE_parameters[] query because
  of the proper error handling (index range checks).

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  Help directive was causing a segfault when applied to directives. Fixed.

2006-06-25  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Function phoebe_spectrum_free () caused a segfault in case when a NULL
  argument was passed. Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  Functions phoebe_vector_free () and phoebe_array_free () caused a segfault
  when a NULL pointer was passed. Fixed.

2006-06-23  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:
  Comments in the transform_magnitude_sigma_to_flux_sigma were wrong; fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Indeed, two regressions have been found and both have been fixed; while
  at it, I also added full support for spots that was missing so far.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.c:
  Finished! :) All up-to-the-specs corrections of phoebe_parameters source
  file have been done! This means that finally this long-lasting TODO
  entry has been removed! Caution is still advised because of heavy changing
  of the sources, I will spend today in testing and fixing if any problem
  jumps out.

  Another two phoebe_parameters.c functions (and their dependencies) cleaned.
  That leaves 4 tough ones to go...

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/Makefile.am, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_connectivity.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_connectivity.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
  Sources phoebe_connectivity.c and phoebe_connectivity.h have become
  obsolete and are now removed from the distribution.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.c:
  More code tidying and specs conformation done. I really hope to finish
  this task as soon as possible and, even more, I really hope it is worth
  the effort. This way we will have a very clean, specs-compliant code to
  work with and develop... :)

  * phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_base.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c, phoebe-scripter/phoebe-scripter.prj, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c:
  A heavy and substantial code beautification and up-to-specs conformation
  done for phoebe_parameters.c source and all other affected sources. The
  changes were quite voluminous, and some care should be taken and some
  effort invested to verify that no regressions have been introduced.

  A bunch of functions adapted to the SPECS, particularly in the phoebe_
  calculations.c sources. Most functions are now returning error codes,
  and the ones which still don't are not dangerous. This removed every
  instance of 'return -1' or similar prohibited error code.

2006-06-04  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c:
  There were two trivial errors in phoebe_init () code that attempted
  to access limb darkening tables although these were not present on the
  system (and the config file included this information). It was obviously
  very late when I was writing that... ;) Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/configure, phoebe-scripter/configure.ac, phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_build_config.h.in:
  Configure script modified to output the information on GNU readline
  presence in the summary table. Newer autotools are now used to create
  the script.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c:
  Optional GSL dependency was broken by the explicit dependence of function
  chi2_cost_function () on gsl_vector * variable. This has now been
  #ifdef-ed and PHOEBE builds without GSL again.

  * phoebe-lib/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/aclocal.m4, phoebe-lib/configure, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_build_config.h.in, phoebe-lib/wd/Makefile.in:
  Development distribution changed from Ubuntu Breezy to Ubuntu Dapper.
  A very useful and welcome side effect is a newer version of libtool
  that does not depend on g++ anymore. The distributed configure script
  will thus no longer require g++ to be installed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_configuration.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_plotting.c:
  The same fixup (erroneaus errno usage) done for other pieces of code.
  The library is now clean from this issue.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c:
  I just learned that errno value is not preserved after any IO call,
  including printf; from the documentation:

  A common mistake is to do

        if (somecall() == -1) {
            printf("somecall() failed\n");
            if (errno == ...) { ... }
        }

  where  errno  no longer needs to have the value it had upon return from
  somecall() (i.e., it may have been changed by the  printf()).   If  the
  value  of  errno  should be preserved across a library call, it must be
  saved:

        if (somecall() == -1) {
            int errsv = errno;
            printf("somecall() failed\n");
            if (errsv == ...) { ... }
        }

  This is now fixed in phoebe_open_directory and phoebe_close_directory
  functions.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_ld.c:
  The LD readout function was checking /local/ directory structure, failing
  to open non-existent /global/ files in the DIR * variable. This caused
  problems in LD readouts if there were directories present in the ld/
  directory. Since the catalogs are moved to the CVS, the auxiliary CVS/
  directory appears in the catalogs/ld directory on systems where catalogs
  are checked out from the CVS.

  Fixing this bug also gave the opportunity to make two fool-proof functions
  phoebe_open_directory () and phoebe_close_directory (), which are placed
  to phoebe_accessories.c.h. Error handling functions have been updated
  accordingly.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c:
  CTRL+C was disabled, and proper handling in the scripter (and elsewhere)
  has not been done yet. This caused inconvenience of having to kill the
  process explicitly by the kill command. The signal has been temporarily
  re-enabled.

2006-05-27  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex:
  Upon Josef Kallrath's request a new builtin function strlen () has been
  implemented. It returns the length of the passed string.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.am, phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_arithmetics.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_arithmetics.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.h:
  Arithmetic operations on ASTs (and their evaluated values) are being moved
  to the newly introduced source files phoebe_scripter_arithmetics.c and .h.
  This will reduce the problem of the totally crowded phoebe_scripter_ast.c
  source file.

2006-05-25  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Two new functions for primitive adding and subtracting spectra have been
  used in the binary operations, e.g. 'set s = s1 + s2' and
  'set s = s1 - s2'. Others are soon to follow.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Two functions for primitive adding and subtracting spectra implemented.
  Primitive means that the wavelengths of both operands must be aligned.
  An error status ERROR_SPECTRA_NOT_ALIGNED has been added to signal the
  problem with non-aligned wavelengths.

2006-05-16  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Scripter command set_parameter_value () was registered twice. Fixed.

2006-05-09  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:
  Additional small fixups and enhancements regarding sigma-to-weight trans-
  formation done. The function has been pretty fairly tested and should be
  ok for scientific use now.

  There is a caveat that should be added to the docs: if one wants all
  photometric and/or RV data points to be taken with equal weights, one
  must not use standard deviations in the magnitude regime, since the
  transformation depends on the individual flux value. Thus weights must
  be used and set to an equal value, e.g. 1.0.

  * phoebe-lib/TODO: TODO list empty again! :)

  * phoebe-lib/TODO, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h:
  Transformation of the flux sigma to magnitude sigma slightly improved in
  cases of small SNR. The functions that do the transformation have been
  heavily commented.

  Another important fixup concerns the magnitude sigma to flux weight
  transformation; the original w = 1/\sigma^2 scheme was troublesome for
  small values of \sigma, because the weights were overflowing the 4-char
  space allowed by WD. The weights are now rescaled to the 0.01-10.0
  interval. Higher values are intentionally left empty, we use 99.0 for
  \sigma = 0 values.

  A smaller fixup of the same function concerns cases when \sigma's that
  were passed were negative. This happened in several occasions when users
  used Rucinski's 3rd RV column as standard deviations. This is of course
  wrong to do, but PHOEBE now reports this problem and aborts.

  Finally, the read_in_observational_data () function was phoebe_debug()'ed.

  The original functionality of get_parameter_value () command has been
  restored. The user may now use both variants to obtain values for array
  qualifiers, namely:

  	set var = get_parameter_value (qualifier)
  	set var = get_parameter_value (qualifier, index)

  The first form will return an array in case the qualifier is an array and
  the second form will return a scalar of the type that corresponds to that
  qualifier.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
  Function phoebe_get_parameter_value () still used numeric error codes to
  signal errors. Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  A serious problem was discovered in the phoebe_array_duplicate () function
  that did not copy string contents to the duplicate string. This in turn
  caused failure in reading out values from string array qualifiers. Fixed.

  Incidentally, several other functions were cleaned (so as to conform to
  the SPECS) and enhanced (improved error handling).

2006-03-23  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Error handling in set_parameter_value () command improved. A small bug
  has also been discovered that caused a failure in automatic int->double
  propagation; fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/main.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  All instances of phoebe_error () replaced with phoebe_scripter_error (),
  which wraps around the original phoebe_error () function while adding the
  error messages that are purely scripter-related.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Stale #include statements removed from phoebe_scripter_types.c.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c:
  Print functions were not conforming to SPECS regarding return values
  (they were still returning negative status codes). Fixed.

2006-03-22  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c:
  Stale #include statements removed from phoebe_scripter_io.c.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  Stale #include statements removed from phoebe_scripter_directives.c.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/main.c:
  Stale (yet commented) #include statements that were referring to individual
  header files of the library removed from main.c.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  Slight formatting fixups throughout the code.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h:
  A trailing comma in scripter_ast_value type enum removed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Function scripter_ast_value_free () was triggering an exception handler
  on type_void, which is attributed to all optional parameters that are not
  passed to commands. This type is now handled explicitly (falls through).

2006-03-21  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c:
  Function read_in_synthetic_data () segfaulted if the vectors weren't
  initialized. Error checking is now implemented that prevents this.

2006-03-16  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Another small memory leak found and removed: type_qualifier variables
  initialized a string that was never freed. Fixed. Exception handler is now
  added to scripter_ast_value_free () function.

2006-03-13  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Sigh... Another tiny memory leak discovered and removed. These 8-byte
  leaks are really annoying... Anyway, the problem was in the reverse_list
  function if it is called with the same pointer as the one that is being
  reversed. There was an instance in the user-defined function handler that
  is now fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c:
  Recent changes in the spectra handling functions of the library imposed
  a change in the driver functions. All of them have been simplified and
  reduced in size, so the change in prototypes is indeed welcome.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  All spectra handling functions that return a new spectrum have been
  homogenized in their prototype; they all return int and the first argument
  is the pointer to the pointer to the spectrum which is allocated in the
  function itself. This makes it more transparent for the driving functions
  since for all handlers the result only needs to be freed after usage.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  The usage of double pointers in phoebe_spectra_merge () and phoebe_
  spectra_multiply () functions has been replaced with a single pointer.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Another small memory leak due to a stale pointer fixed in the spectrum
  resampling function; error-handling was also improved in the phoebe_
  _spectra_merge () function.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  A small memory leak in phoebe_spectrum_free () removed (stale pointer).

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  Function phoebe_vector_new_from_column () left a file open. Fixed.

2006-03-07  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h:
  Redundant scripter_ast_detach_list () function removed.

  * phoebe-scripter/configure, phoebe-scripter/configure.ac, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.h:
  After 15 straight hours of work, I reduced the percentage of memory leaks
  in the scripter to 0.0%, which amounts to 0 lost blocks! A gigantic work,
  believe me, and now if you don't mind, I'll go pass out... ;) I *am* happy,
  though, as this makes me realize that memory management was pretty much
  on the track from the beginning. :)

  * phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in:
  Updated Makefile.in to correspond to the new Makefile.am.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.am:
  Makefile changed so that the flexer generates the header file phoebe_
  _scripter_grammar.h. This header file should be included whenever the
  flexer's buffer is needed, because the typedefs are otherwise unavailable.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.h:
  This file will now be automatically generated by the flexer, it is thus
  removed from the CVS.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_ld.c:
  LD read-in function left the LD files open; fixed.

2006-03-06  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  A small memory leak in the info directive fixed; this does not seem like
  much, but if e.g. spectra were copied, they could have consumed a lot of
  memory.

2006-03-05  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Memory management has finally been improved. The ASTs are now getting
  freed as soon as they are no longer needed; the strategy for freeing is
  the following: ASTs are created by the parser and evaluated once the
  kind_statement node is built. When this evaluation is finished, the AST
  is no longer required and it is freed. The current code was almost ready
  for this step, with two notable exceptions: functions and macros. In their
  definition, only AST pointers were referenced in the symbol table, whereas
  they are now getting freed as soon as their definition (node evaluation)
  is done. This has been fixed by implementing a new AST function called
  scripter_ast_duplicate () that does just that: duplicates an AST. A pointer
  to this copy is now stored in a symbol table, so the original AST may well
  be freed.

  Everything seems to be working after these changes, but please note that
  due to their nature (fiddling with memory) and initial implementation
  things may go wrong. Badly wrong. ;) If there's anyone on Earth reading
  this besides me (which I doubt), please report any segfaults you might
  encounter.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Oops, the first memory leak from the previous commit actually wasn't a
  leak, it was supposed to be that way; the ASTs and AST values are two
  different structures and each needs its own allocation. Fixed.

2006-03-04  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Two very significant memory leaks have been fixed: the AST evaluation
  function made copies of primitive type AST arrays (vectors, arrays,
  spectra), which only duplicated memory needlessly. The second memory
  leak was caused by a stale original AST that was copied to the newly
  allocated AST node in the symbol table. Both have been fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  A file in phoebe_spectrum_get_from_file () function did not get closed,
  which caused a failure in opening after the number of open files has
  reached the maximum. Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Another esthetical change in function phoebe_get_spectrum_from_file ().

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Function phoebe_get_spectrum_from_file () fool-proofed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.h:
  Prototype of function scripter_ast_value_array_free () changed to take a
  pointer instead of pointer-to-pointer. This is done only for esthetic
  reasons.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c: A typo in a comment fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  A bug in symbol_table_lookup () function caused a segfault if a
  non-existent table was looked up. This bug occured only when stdump
  directive was used with a non-existing symbol table; since this directive
  is internal, the users are not affected by this issue. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Two changes:

  1) the command convolve_spectra () renamed to multiply_spectra (),
     according to the samewise change in the library,

  2) the kind_set_element node now handles spectral columns as well, e.g.

       set sp[2] = sp[2]/10

     will divide the 2nd column of the spectrum 'sp' (usually flux) by 10.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Function phoebe_spectra_convolve () renamed to phoebe_spectra_multiply (),
  as this is exactly what the function does and the convolution is exactly
  what the function doesn't do. ;)

2006-03-03  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Spectrum columns may now be extracted as identifier elements. For a given
  spectrum s, for example, s[1] will return an array of wavelengths (or
  whatever appears in the first column) and s[2] will return an array of
  fluxes (or whatever appears in the second column).

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Function phoebe_spectrum_get_column () added that extracts a column from
  a spectrum and returns it as a newly allocated vector. It takes two
  arguments, a spectrum and the column index; the index may be 1 or 2, for
  wavelength or flux, respectively.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Two instances of 'vector' in scripter output messages changed to 'array'.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Error handling significantly improved for most SED functions. Along the
  way a bug was discovered in rotational broadening function that failed
  if negative values of vsini were passed to it. It now substitutes vsini
  with its absolute value and then broadens the spectrum.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Command add_spectra () renamed to merge_spectra ().

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Function phoebe_spectra_add () renamed to phoebe_spectra_merge ().

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c: The resampling function optimized.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.am, phoebe-scripter/help/resample_spectrum.help, phoebe-scripter/phoebe-scripter.prj, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Error handling for resample_spectrum () command has been improved and a
  corresponding help file has been added.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  The phoebe_spectrum_resample () function returned -1 when there was no
  overlap between the input spectrum and the region to which a spectrum
  should be resampled. This is now handled with the error handler.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Function phoebe_spectrum_realloc () was suffering from a similar problem
  as phoebe_spectrum_alloc (). Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Function phoebe_spectrum_alloc () was still using negative values to
  refer to errors; fixed. All instances of callers have been updated to
  check for status when allocating memory.

2006-02-27  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Debugging scripter ASTs has been rewritten and is now both more informative
  and visually more attractive, given in a rigorously strict tabular form.
  This will show only when the scripter is configured with the --enable-debug
  switch.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  The phoebe_spectrum_apply_doppler_shift () function did not copy the
  information on resolving power and sampling to the shifted spectrum;
  fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  A new grammar design for directives caused the bypassing of kind_statement
  node creation (which must be its void parent); fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/phoebe-scripter.prj, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  User-defined function evaluation did not account for spectra; fixed. In
  addition, an exception handling has been added to the evaluation function
  that asks the users to report such inconsistencies should they occur in
  future.

  * phoebe-scripter/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.am, phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_build_config.h.in:
  Makefiles now install the added help files with the distribution.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/apply_doppler_shift.help, phoebe-scripter/phoebe-scripter.prj:
  Help file for apply_doppler_shift () command added.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/apply_rotational_broadening.help, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Command apply_rotational_broadening () added to the scripter, including a
  help file.

  Synopsis:

    set out = apply_rotational_broadening (in, vsini, x_ld)

  Here 'in' is the input spectrum, 'vsini' is the projected radial velocity
  and 'x_ld' is a linear limb-darkening coefficient. The command convolves
  the original spectrum with a broadening function G(\lambda) adopted after
  Gray's Chapter 17, p. 374.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  A function for applying the rotational (Doppler) broadening of spectral
  lines added to phoebe_spectra.c. The function uses Gray's convolution
  method (see Chapter 17, p. 374).

2006-02-25  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Command spectrum () added. It takes three arguments: the dimension of the
  spectrum, the true resolving power R and the sampling power Rs.

  * phoebe-scripter/phoebe-scripter.prj, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  The array () command implementation was obsolete - it used a separate AST
  that didn't conform to the standard definition of commands in the scripter.
  The command is now added and registered properly.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/info.help: Help file for the info directive updated.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Command set_spectrum_properties () was changing the properties of the
  copy of the spectrum rather than the variable contents themselves. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  The 'info' directive has been generalized to display information not only
  on qualifiers, but on variables as well. The user may now do something like
  the following:

    set i=1
    set j=vector(5)
    info i
    info j

  The directive will list the variable type and in the latter case the
  variable dimension. It will *not* write out its value - directive print
  should be used for that.

2006-02-24  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
  Spectrum broadening function now correctly computes the FWHM of the
  Gaussian with which the input spectrum is convolved with. This did not
  present a significant accuracy problem for substantial resolution
  degradation, but when broadening from e.g. 50.000 to 40.000 it caused an
  overestimation of the FWHM. Fixed.

2006-02-23  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Two new commands have been implemented:

    set_spectrum_properties (s, R, Rs),

  where 's' is the target spectrum, 'R' is the true resolving power and 'Rs'
  is the sampling power of the spectrum;

    set_lc_properties (curve_idx, passband, indep, dep, weight, sigma, fname)

  where all arguments correspond to parameters that fully determine LCs.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
  Slight formatting fixups of the source code layout.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
  Fields for resolving power (R) and sampling power (Rs) added to the
  PHOEBE_spectrum typedef. This will be used for all kinds of things, from
  basic information presented to the user to proper computation of the
  broadening function.

2006-02-21  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Help directive updated so that it automatically handles all commands. If
  a help file is missing for a particular command, the scripter will write
  a notice to the user about it. It will work for user-contributed commands
  as well - they only need to be accompanied with command_name.help file in
  the help/ directory.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/broaden_spectrum.help, phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.am:
  Help file for the broaden_spectrum () command added.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
  Command broaden_spectrum () added to the scripter. This function utilizes
  the newly added library function phoebe_spectrum_broaden ().

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
  Function phoebe_spectrum_broaden () added to the library. This function
  takes three arguments: the input spectrum, the output spectrum and the
  true resolution of the output spectrum. The sampling resolution of the
  output spectrum is the same as of the input spectrum (and it has nothing
  to do with the true resolution, naturally).

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Needless dereferencing of pointers in phoebe_ast_free () definition
  removed and all calling instances updated.

2006-02-07  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.h:
  Function phoebe_strdup () added that is a direct copy from GNU C library.
  This function is provided because there are some C libraries out there
  that do not define strdup() function and, besides, this function breaks
  ANSI C specifications. All instances of strdup () should be replaced with
  phoebe_strdup () as soon as possible.

2006-02-06  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex: Excessive tabs removed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Stale tokens removed from the parser.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Parser rule lit_or_id removed in favor of the more general expr. The only
  two uses of this grammar structure were the statement redirection
  operators, both of them already had proper error handling implemented
  that needed no adaptation to the new grammar logic. This further simplified
  grammar rules.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_error_handling.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.h:
  A major rewrite in scripter command logic has been done. Commands are now
  dynamically defined by calling the scripter_command_register () function
  defined in phoebe_scripter_types.c. Both lexer and parser, as well as AST
  handler, are significantly simplified because of this rewrite. A side
  effect is that all commands are now uniformly prototyped to return
  scripter_ast_value. Several small memory leaks have also been identified
  and removed.

  The bottom line is that external plugin-like codes can simply register
  new scripter commands without having to interfere with scripter grammar
  directly. This will be extremely useful once people start writing plugins
  to PHOEBE.

2006-02-03  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c:
  Data parsing now removes the DOS newline characters (ASCII code 13) if
  they are found. This issue caused segfaults of the 0.2x branch on certain
  architectures, so I include this test here as well, just in case.

2006-02-02  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
  Functions have been reordered in this header file to conform to the
  function layout in the corresponding C file.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  All vector-handling functions in phoebe_types.c have been made compliant
  with specifications for error handling and commented descriptions.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
  Parsing rule for DOS' carriage return symbol (ASCII code 13) added to the
  phoebe_vector_from_column () function.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  Command plot_spectrum_using_gnuplot () added. It takes three arguments,
  the spectrum to be plotted, and optionally a lower and upper wavelength
  interval limits:

    plot_spectrum_using_gnuplot (spectrum [, ll, ul])

  The function has been fool-proofed and tested to a reasonable extend.

2006-01-30  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  The same change, only this time done right! ;)

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  Out-of-bounds check for curve index added for commands
  plot_lc_using_gnuplot () and plot_rv_using_gnuplot ().

2006-01-29  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  AST node for the command set_parameter_step () passed the parent node to
  the library, which caused OB1 error in argument count. Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_wd_algorithms.f:
  A bunch of bugs are found and removed from the surface temperature handling
  when the DC minimizer was used:

  1) the step-size was given in K, but 10000K were expected,
  2) the corrections were multiplied by 1000 instead of 10000 and
  3) the values in K were multiplied by 1000 needlessly.

  What the heck was I thinking? It had to be very late... %-)

2006-01-26  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.in: Makefile.in added to facilitate builds.

2006-01-18  prsa  <prsa@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/configure, phoebe-scripter/configure.ac, phoebe-gui/configure, phoebe-gui/configure.ac:
  An autoconf checkup added for the presence of PHOEBE library. If it is
  absent, ./configure stops with a failure.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/Makefile.am:
  Distribution file Makefile.am added.

  This ChangeLog part consists of two pretty large changes which are completely
  different; the CVS server is down over the weekend, unfortunately, so I
  couldn't have committed each change separately. Here is the description:

  When defining arrays explicitly, e.g. set a = {1,2,3}, the elements of the
  array itself were evaluated during the parse. This posed no problems for
  arrays in the main script flow, but it caused syntax errors in macro
  definitions where elements of the defined array were variables. Consider the
  following example:

    macro test () {
      set i = 1
      set a = {i, i+1, i+2}
      print a
      }

  This is a perfectly legal macro definition, yet because of read-and-parse
  implementation the parsing of {i, i+1, i+2} caused a syntax error because
  the set directive wasn't yet evaluated and the variable i wasn't yet
  assigned. This is now fixed by changing the evaluation to occur with the
  statement itself and not separately.

  The second change is the total implementation of the prompt () command.
  This command provides input from the user.

  Synopsis:

    set answer = prompt ("Question? " [, "expected_type"])

  First argument is a string that is used as the prompt to which the user
  has to give an answer. The answer is then parsed and returned as an
  expression. Typically one whould use this command as:

    set answer = prompt ("Is this correct [Y/n]? ")

  The second argument is optional and may be used to test the answer type.
  The expected_type is a string that must be one of the following:

    integer, boolean, double, string

  The command is completely fool-proof and will loop until the answer to the
  prompt is acceptable by the lexer. The command will interrupt on empty input
  or on CTRL+D.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
  Two accessory functions added:

    * bool  atob (char *str)
    * char *phoebe_type_get_name (PHOEBE_type type)

  atob () is a natural extension to C's ato* family of functions that
  converts a string to the boolean and returns it.

  phoebe_type_get_name returns the string with the name of PHOEBE_type
  variable.

  The command convolve_spectra () did not take optional arguments into
  account, it always used 2500, 10500, 50000 values. Fixed.

2005-12-21  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Function phoebe_vector_new_from_list () contained a memory leak in case
  of a failed assignment. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.h:
  Architecture for handling spectra has been implemented. It is still
  rudimentary, but most important operations are already supported. They
  include:

  	- reading out a spectrum from a file
  	- reading out a spectrum from repository
  	- setting a spectra repository
  	- applying a Doppler shift to a spectrum
  	- resampling a spectrum to the given wavelength interval and
  	  a given resolution
  	- weighted sumation of two spectra
  	- convolving two spectra

  The scripter features the following new commands which are fully
  functional:

  	set_spectra_repository (dirname)
  	set var = get_spectrum_from_repository (T, log g/g0, [M/H], vrot)
  	set var = get_spectrum_from_file (filename)
  	set var = resample_spectrum (spectrum, ll, ul, R)
  	set var = scripter_integrate_spectrum (spectrum [, ll, ul])
  	set var = add_spectra (spec1, spec2 [, w1, w2])
  	set var = convolve_spectra (spec1, spec2 [, ll, ul, R])

  Some of them still need to be polished, but the main functionality is
  tested.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_global.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:

  These functions are prototyped in phoebe_spectra.h. Several related
  sources also needed to be modified slightly.

2005-12-14  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/Makefile.am, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_build_config.h.in, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_roche.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_roche.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_wd_algorithms.f, phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.prj, phoebe-lib/wd/Makefile.in:
  Two new source files added, phoebe_roche.c and phoebe_roche.h. These two
  files host all scientific functions that are used for computation of the
  Roche formalism and are meant to supersede the WD subroutines eventually.
  In the mean time they are used to compute some auxiliary quantities like
  the polar radii and similar.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_global.h:
  Architecture for catching software break interrupts (SIGINTs == CTRL+C)
  implemented. There is now a global variable called PHOEBE_INTERRUPT that is set
  to FALSE by default and it is changed to TRUE by the interrupt handler. All
  functions that are susceptible to software breaks (i.e. fitting functions,
  computation functions etc) need to test against the value of PHOEBE_INTERRUPT
  and stop the execution if it is TRUE. The same goes for all scripter loops that
  need to be interrupted. The first function that makes use of this new architec-
  ture is the NMS function. If the function is interrupted, the memory is nicely
  freed, the value of chi2 is set to nan and the function returns gracefully.

2005-11-11  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:
  When transforming HJDs to phases, negative dP/dt values were not properly
  transformed because of a malformed test (dpdt < 1E-15) instead of
  (fabs(dpdt) < 1E-15). Fixed.

2005-11-05  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:
  Error handling of calculate_chi2 () function was too restrictive: it
  demanded the weight array to be allocated even if there was no weighting
  applied. Fixed.

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.h:
  Functions call_wd_to_get_* were defined as void, which doesn't suit the
  specifications. All three functions changed to int.

2005-11-01  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Hopefully this fixes the last regression that was introduced by returning
  pointers instead of copied data by scripter_ast_evaluate () function. All
  directives and commands are supposed to free the evaluated arguments once
  they are done using them so that memory leaks don't occur. If the variables
  contained only pointers to the data, the pointers would have been freed
  and the original data would be lost. Fixed.

2005-10-30  gal  <gal@gemma>

  * phoebe-gui/src/main.c, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.file_select.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.logging.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.main.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.plot_lc.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.potential_calc.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_global.h:
  A few callbacks regarding ephemeris and system parameters were added. Callbacks
  are now arranged in order that follows PHOEBE's structure. That means that
  menubar callbacks are in the beging of file followed by toolbar, data,
  ephemeris and so on. Also frequently used callbacks like ones setting PHOEBE's
  parameters were put in separate category.

2005-10-29  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  Would you believe it -- yet another regression. :( The print directive
  failed to increment pointers and thus mayhem occured if there was more
  than 1 value printed. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  The same OB1 regression as below has affected compute_lc () and
  compute_rv () commands. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/Makefile.am, phoebe-scripter/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/configure, phoebe-scripter/configure.ac, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
  A critical regression was discovered due to an OB1 error: the
  set_parameter_value () command did not properly update the values of
  arrays. Fixed.

2005-10-25  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c, phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h:
  Two convenience functions added to the library:

  	phoebe_set_parameter_lower_limit (qualifier, lower_limit)
  	phoebe_set_parameter_upper_limit (qualifier, upper_limit)

  These two functions were requested by Gal for the GUI. The original
  function that sets both limits simultaneously:

  	phoebe_set_parameter_limits (qualifier, lower_limit, upper_limit)

  is still present.

2005-10-22  Andrej Prša  <andrej@gemma>

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  An obsolete help-printing function removed from the code. Help for the
  'while' loop added.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/while.help: Help file added.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
  Functions are now added to the global symbol table as well.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
  Symbol table handling frozen. There are two alternatives how to handle
  identifiers: to have automatic variables and only one scope per function
  or to have declared variables and local scopes. Since I think declarations
  are not practical for interpreted language, I decided to go with the first
  alternative. That is why all symbol tables feature variables that preserve
  their validity throughout the function/macro.

  There are two symbol tables that are generated on start-up: a global symbol
  table that contains all constants (CONST_* identifiers) and all macro and
  function names (initially empty), and the main symbol table that contains
  all variables that are declared within the main script structure (also
  initially empty). As new macros and functions are defined, new symbol
  tables are appended to a linked list. The lookup function first searches
  for a symbol in the symbol table of the current macro/function and then in
  the global symbol table. This enables macros/functions to call other
  macros/functions and to have all constants globally available. For example,
  the code:

  > macro func1 () {
  >	print CONST_PI
  > }
  >
  > macro func2 () {
  > 	func1 ()
  > }
  >
  > func2 ()

  is perfectly ok.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.h, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.h:
  Symbol table scoping removed completely. There seem to be two alternatives
  for handling symbol tables: having automatic variables and only a global
  scope or having declared variables and local scopes. Since it is not really
  practical for the interpreter to enforce variable declarations, I decided
  to go with the former alternative.

  * phoebe-gui/ChangeLog:
  Following the change of SPECS established on Oct 18, the ChangeLog is
  removed from the CVS. It will now be created for the distribution by
  issuing:

      rcs2log -i 2 > ChangeLog

  This means that the ChangeLog build is now completely up to CVS and that
  the developers must describe the commited changes properly, not merely by
  the change date anymore.

  * phoebe-lib/ChangeLog:
    Following the change of SPECS established on Oct 18, the ChangeLog is
    removed from the CVS. It will now be created for the distribution by
    issuing:

    	rcs2log -i 2 > ChangeLog

    This means that the ChangeLog build is now completely up to CVS and that
    the developers must describe the commited changes properly, not merely by
    the change date anymore.

  * phoebe-scripter/ChangeLog:
  Following the agreement between Gal and myself, the ChangeLog is removed
  from the CVS. It will now be created for the distribution by issuing:

  	rcs2log -i 2 > ChangeLog

  This means that the ChangeLog build is now completely up to CVS and that
  the developers must describe the commited changes properly, not merely by
  the change date anymore.

  * phoebe-scripter/ChangeLog, phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
  Online help system has been moved from hard-coded text to external files.
  The help directive now accesses these external help files and prints them
  on PHOEBE_output. Help files are put in the top-level help/ directory and
  will be installed in /usr/local/share/phoebe/help by default.

  * phoebe-scripter/help/info.help: Help file added.

  * Grammar and directives further cleaned: calc, clear, print and stdump
    are now properly handled. In particular, the print directive now does
    not print its arguments as they are evaluated, but evaluates all
    arguments first and prints them out only if everything is ok. This
    removes error messages from the print output.

  * Error handler was leaking memory in case when the AST memory was
    allocated, but the AST type was invalid. Fixed.

  * phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
  The bison grammar file missed a semi-colon at the 'qualifier' non-terminal.
  It's curious to see that this error doesn't jump out under linux, but it
  does jump out under mac. Many thanks to Romain Gauderon for pointing this
  out!

  All variable declarations that appeared in header files have been moved to
  the corresponding source files. Header declarations are still present, but
  they are now declared as extern. This was done to get PHOEBE to compile
  under Mac OSX 10.4. Many thanks to Romain Gauderon for his effort to trace
  and point out the cause of the busted build under Mac!
