This is a simple script for comparing phoebe 1 and phoebe 2 models. For this to work you must have phoebeBackend installed. This is in phoebe-code/stable. Instructions are below. 


Instructions for installing phoebeBackend

cd phoebe-lib
./configure
make
sudo make install

cd phoebe-py

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

You may be missing a setup file. You can get one either by installing the gui as well and starting it...or just ask someone else on the development team to give you theirs.

Contents:

default.phoebe - initial phoebe 1 parameter file

compfun.py: contains a set of functions that allows ph1to2comp.py to function properly.

ph1to2comp.py

This is the file you will run. The parameters which are tested are split into two main groups:

1.) Parameters that are normally fixed (e.g. gravity brightening) OR fitting options such as heating (controlled by things like albedo).

2.) Grid parameters. These are things such as period, inclination, mass ratio. Technically anything can be a grid parameter, but as computation time is an issuethis is slightly limited. Adding extra parameters should be straightforward.
