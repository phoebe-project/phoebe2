        Create and submit a job on a <RemoteSlurmServer>.

        Under-the-hood, this creates a subdirectory in <RemoteSlurmServer.directory>
        based on the provided or assigned `job_name`.  All submitted scripts/files
        (through either <RemoteSlurmJob.run_script> or <RemoteSlurmJob.submit_script>)
        are copied to and run in this directory.

        Arguments
        -------------
        * `server` (<RemoteSlurmServer>, optional, default=None): server to
            use when running the job.  If `server` is not provided, `host` must
            be provided.
        * `job_name` (string, optional, default=None): name for this job instance.
            If not provided, one will be created from the current datetime and
            accessible through <RemoteSlurmJob.job_name>.  This `job_name` will
            be necessary to reconnect to a previously submitted job.
        * `conda_env` (string or None, optional, default=None): name of
            the conda environment to use for the job or False to not use a
            conda environment.  If not passed or None, will default to 'default'
            if conda is installed on the server or to False otherwise.
        * `isolate_env` (bool, optional, default=False): whether to clone
            the `conda_env` for use in this job.  If True, any setup/installation
            done by this job will not affect the original environment and
            will not affect other jobs.  Note that the environment is cloned
            (and therefore isolated) at the first call to <<class>.run_script>

        Arguments
        ----------------
        * `script` (string or list): shell script to run on the remote server,

            can call any other scripts in `files`.  If a string, must be the

            must be a list of commands (i.e. a newline will be placed between

            `script`.
