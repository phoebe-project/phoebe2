The source-code for autofig is maintained in a separate repository but is copied directly here so that the exact version can be matched (without require a strict version dependency in pip, for example).  Follow the link above for its documentation or to install globally on your system (outside of PHOEBE).

## Developer note:

To update to a newer version of autofig, clone the autofig repository locally, and copy all files within the 'autofig' directory (as well as the LICENSE file in the root directory) here, update the version and link to the tree at that commit above, and commit changes to PHOEBE.  The building/installing is now handled by PHOEBE's setup.py as autofig doesn't need any special settings.
